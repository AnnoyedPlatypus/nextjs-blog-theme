Dabblings in AI is a playground for the use of generative AI in creating content.

What I will do is regularly pick a topic of the day from whatever media I'm consuming and then use that with a [Large Language Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) to create some content.

_Isn't that what everyone is doing?_

Yes but I'll also take some time to review and find fault in the content or other aspects of the AI created content. This way people should get useful information btu also become more aware of the issues with trusting content created in this way. Which is everywhere.

**Why?**

I've been really slack at creating content in my old blog.To the point that it might be once a year that I write something useful.

So (this sounds really bad) rather than create all the content, I'll get the AI to do that and then critique it. The content should still be useful to people as any issues will be highlighted.
