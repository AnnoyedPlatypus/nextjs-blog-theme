**_Give me examples of markdown language used in coding and specifically how to use italics._**

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format text. It is commonly used in coding to create documentation, README files, and other types of text files. Here is an example of how to use italics in Markdown:

- To create italicized text, you can surround the text with either a single asterisk (*) or a single underscore (_). For example, `*italicized text*` or `_italicized text_` will both produce _italicized text_.

Here are some other examples of Markdown syntax:

- To create bold text, you can surround the text with two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__). For example, `**bold text**` or `__bold text__` will both produce **bold text**.
- To create a heading, you can use one or more hash symbols (#) followed by a space and the heading text. For example, `# Heading 1` will create a first-level heading, while `## Heading 2` will create a second-level heading.
- To create a list, you can use either an asterisk (*), a plus sign (+), or a hyphen (-) followed by a space and the list item. For example:

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
```

will create an unordered list with three items.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. ðŸ˜Š.

### Review ###

Microsoft's Bing AI is inconsistent in its answers but when it does answer it is more recent and offers more info that ChatGPT. That could make answers more difficult to use if too much information is provided.

When asked about it's own state and most recent data set it failed to answer. Bing AI often does this when the answer may expose a hint about its inner workings.

In almost every answer it comes across with more human traits like emojis and hoping that it was helpful.
