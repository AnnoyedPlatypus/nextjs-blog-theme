**_Give me examples of markdown language used in coding and specifically how to use italics._**

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format text. It is commonly used in coding to create documentation, README files, and other types of text files. Here is an example of how to use italics in Markdown:

- To create italicized text, you can surround the text with either a single asterisk (*) or a single underscore (_). For example, `*italicized text*` or `_italicized text_` will both produce _italicized text_.

Here are some other examples of Markdown syntax:

- To create bold text, you can surround the text with two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__). For example, `**bold text**` or `__bold text__` will both produce **bold text**.
- To create a heading, you can use one or more hash symbols (#) followed by a space and the heading text. For example, `# Heading 1` will create a first-level heading, while `## Heading 2` will create a second-level heading.
- To create a list, you can use either an asterisk (*), a plus sign (+), or a hyphen (-) followed by a space and the list item. For example:

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
```

will create an unordered list with three items.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. üòä.

**_Create me a picture if a group of four people sitting around a camp fire as a family. Their two tents are in the background and you can see a lake through some trees._**

I'll try to create that. It sounds like a cozy and relaxing scene. A camp fire is a source of light, warmth, and comfort in the outdoors. It can also be used for cooking, roasting marshmallows, or telling stories. A family is a group of people who share a bond of love, support, and care for each other. Camping is a recreational activity that involves staying overnight in a tent or other shelter, usually in a natural setting. Camping can be a fun way to enjoy nature, explore new places, and spend quality time with family or friends. üèïÔ∏è

### Review ###

Microsoft's Bing Copilot AI is inconsistent in its answers but when it does answer it is more recent and offers more info than ChatGPT. That could make answers more difficult to use if too much information is provided.

Copilot does provide references in some of the answers which help validate answers. Unfortunately the reference numbering in the answer body doesn't always align with the references in the answer footer.

When asked about it's own state and most recent data set it failed to answer. Bing AI often does this when the answer may expose a hint about its inner workings.

In almost every answer it comes across with more human traits like emojis and hoping that it was helpful.

The Copilot name is also confusing as Microsoft have chosen to use this in many of their services. Bing Copilot, Microsoft 365 Copilot, Microsoft Copilot for Service, etc.

Being able to create images from the same tool is useful and for the most part they're good quality and relevant. Some of the basic requirements were not met. All the images had more than four people in them.
