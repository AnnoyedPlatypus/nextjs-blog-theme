**_What is [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)?_**

ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI, and it belongs to the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) family. GPT models are based on transformer architectures, which are a type of neural network architecture designed for natural language processing tasks.

ChatGPT specifically is trained to generate human-like responses in a conversational style. It has been trained on a diverse range of internet text to learn grammar, facts, reasoning abilities, and to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. The model is capable of understanding and generating text in a variety of contexts, making it suitable for chat-based applications, question answering, and other natural language understanding tasks.

The "chat" aspect of ChatGPT refers to its ability to engage in conversations with users. It can respond to user inputs and provide relevant and contextually appropriate replies, making it useful for interactive and conversational applications.

**_How accurate are you and what's the most recent data you have available?_**

As of my last update in January 2022, I don't have real-time information or updates beyond that date. Therefore, I may not be aware of events or changes that occurred after that point. My responses are based on patterns and information present in the data I was trained on up until January 2022.

Regarding accuracy, it's important to note that while I strive to provide useful and accurate information, I can't guarantee perfection. My responses are generated based on patterns learned from diverse internet sources, and there may be instances where the information is outdated, incomplete, or not entirely precise.

For the most up-to-date and accurate information, especially in rapidly changing fields or current events, it's advisable to check the latest sources or consult experts in the relevant domain.

**_Who is the Prime Minister of Great Britain?_**

As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom was Boris Johnson. However, please note that this information might be outdated, and there could have been changes since then. For the most current information, I recommend checking the latest news sources or the official government website of the United Kingdom.

**_Give me examples of markdown language used in coding and specifically how to use italics._**

Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting plain text. In many programming contexts, including README files on GitHub, documentation, and forum posts, Markdown is used to add formatting to text. To create italic text in Markdown, you can use either asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`). Here are examples:

1. Using asterisks:
   ```markdown
   *This text will be italic.*
   ```

   Output: *This text will be italic.*

2. Using underscores:
   ```markdown
   _This text will also be italic._
   ```

   Output: _This text will also be italic._

You can choose to use either asterisks or underscores, but it's common to stick with one style consistently for readability. Markdown parsers treat both the same way, and the choice is often a matter of personal preference.

### Review ###

This is basic info from this AI and not contentious. It does need to be highlighted that the LLM's are often limited in the content they have available. They are not continuously updated (yet). In this case the fact that the information may not be correct is explained in the response.
